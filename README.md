‚úàÔ∏è Air Traffic Analysis and Optimization
This project focuses on analyzing real-world air traffic data to uncover patterns, improve operational efficiency, and propose optimization strategies for airspace management. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to model air traffic behavior and provide insights that can support decision-making in air traffic control systems.

üîç Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on flight movement, delays, and congestion

Visualization of air traffic patterns and routes

Clustering of flight paths for airspace optimization

Predictive modeling for flight delays and traffic density

Suggestions for improving runway utilization and reducing bottlenecks

üß∞ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis

Real-world aviation datasets (e.g., FAA, OpenSky, ADS-B)

Machine Learning models (Clustering, Regression, Time Series Forecasting)

üìà Outcome
The project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance the safety and efficiency of air traffic systems. It offers a foundation for future tools in real-time airspace monitoring and decision support for ATC systems.
